QUESTION 3B:
-----------

b. To connect the tables in the given database, we need to identify the common columns between them. Here are the common columns between the tables:

The "rfamseq_acc" column in the "rfamseq" table and the "rfamseq_acc" column in the "rfam" table.
The "ncbi_id" column in the "taxonomy" table and the "ncbi_id" column in the "rfamseq" table.
The "rfam_acc" column in the "rfamseq" table and the "rfam_acc" column in the "rfam" table.

We can use these columns to join the tables and extract the relevant information from them.
