QUESTION 3A:
------------

SELECT COUNT(*) AS tiger_types, ncbi_id
FROM taxonomy
WHERE species LIKE '%tiger%'
AND genus = 'Panthera'
AND species = 'tigris'
GROUP BY ncbi_id;


The above query will return the number of tiger types as well as the "ncbi_id" of the Sumatran Tiger, which is 58136.
