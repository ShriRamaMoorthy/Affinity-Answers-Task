- The aim here is to write a simple program in Python that can analyze a file containing Twitter tweets and determine the degree of profanity for each sentence in the file.

- Assumptions
-     The tweets file is in plain text format with each tweet on a separate line
-     The set of words indicating racial slurs is known and provided to the program
-     The program can assume that words indicating racial slurs will be written in a standard format

- Understanding the Dataset and answering the given question
- SQL queries are used, including SELECT, FROM, JOIN, and WHERE clauses, to answer the questions. You may also need to use functions like COUNT to count the number of tigers and DISTINCT to get unique values.

## 4th Question Description
- The shell script is designed to extract only two specific fields from the text file: "Scheme Name" and "Asset Value". 
- The "Scheme Name" field contains the name of the mutual fund scheme, while the "Asset Value" field contains the total value of assets under management for the scheme.
- Once the fields have been extracted, the shell script should save them into a CSV file. The CSV file should be named "output.csv" and should be stored in the same directory as the shell script.
