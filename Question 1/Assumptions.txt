Assumptions:
------------

The input file containing tweets is a plain text file where each tweet is on a separate line.
The racial slurs provided are in lowercase and any tweet containing uppercase versions of the same slurs will not be detected as profane.
The degree of profanity is calculated by dividing the count of racial slurs in the tweet by the total number of words in the tweet.
Tweets with no racial slurs will have a degree of profanity of 0.

This program reads in a file containing tweets, processes each tweet, and calculates the degree of profanity for each tweet using a set of provided racial slurs. 
The program then outputs the tweet and its degree of profanity.
